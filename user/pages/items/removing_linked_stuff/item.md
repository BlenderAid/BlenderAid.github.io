- Go to Outliner
- Switch the view to **Blender File**
- All the way in the bottom are the linked libraries
- Remove the path from unwanted library
- Save and reopen the .blend
- There will be errors that the linked library is missing
- Save and reopen the .blend again
- The .blend file is clean :)
