If you forget to save your image texture from Image Editor (which often happens when painting textures) before quitting or crashing Blender, it would be awesome to have some sort of method for retrieving the unsaved textures.

For example a temporary version of the texture could be saved to Systemâ€™s Temp folder every time Ctrl+S is pressed.
