Often times when you paint textures in Blender, you forget that in addition to saving the .blend file, **you need to specifically save the image texture as well** from Image Editor - otherwise you lose everything you've painted when closing Blender.

It would be awesome to have some sort of method for retrieving the unsaved textures. For example a temporary version of the texture could be saved to Systemâ€™s Temp folder every time Ctrl+S is pressed.
