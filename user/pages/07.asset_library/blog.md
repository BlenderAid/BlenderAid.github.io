# Asset Library

Below you can find a collection of 3D models and materials me and my friends have made and donated for common use.

For quickly throwing around some assets in Blender you might want to consider using the **[Asset Flinger Add-on](https://github.com/BlenderAid/Asset-Flinger)** for that. It's pre-packed with most of the 3D model assets from this page.
